# ðŸ“‚ Dataset Preparation

## How to Prepare Your Dataset

- Collect **1â€“5 face images** for each individual you want to include.

- You can quickly download **celebrity or hero pictures** from the internet within a few minutes.

- Organize the images into the following folder structure:
```
dataset/
    person1/
        img1.jpg
        img2.jpg
        ...
    person2/
        img1.jpg
        img2.jpg
        ...
    ...
```

- Ensure that:
  - Images are **clear** and **frontal-facing**.
  - Images are **not blurry** and preferably have a **plain background**.

- You can also use **your own selfies** or **publicly available face datasets** for testing.
