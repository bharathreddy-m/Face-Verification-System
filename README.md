# 🧠 Face Verification System using Siamese Networks and NAS

## 📜 Project Overview

This project implements a **Face Verification System** that verifies if two given images belong to the same person.  
We designed the system in **two stages**:

1. **Custom CNN Siamese Network with NAS (One Image Per Class)**  
2. **Enhanced Siamese Network using MobileNetV2 (Five Images Per Class)**

By progressively improving the architecture and dataset, we achieved **significant boosts in model performance**.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

- **Stage 1: Basic Siamese Network with NAS**
  - Designed a custom lightweight CNN from scratch.
  - Performed **Neural Architecture Search (NAS)** to further optimize the CNN architecture.
  - Trained using **one image per class** to simulate few-shot learning conditions.
  - Achieved basic verification accuracy suitable for small datasets.

- **Stage 2: Advanced Siamese Network with MobileNetV2**
  - Loaded **MobileNetV2** pretrained on ImageNet as the feature extractor.
  - Increased the training dataset to **five images per class** for stronger generalization.
  - Fine-tuned MobileNetV2 inside the Siamese architecture.
  - Achieved significantly higher verification accuracy.

## 📈 Highlights

✅ Designed custom CNN architecture inside a Siamese Network with NAS optimization.  
✅ Integrated **MobileNetV2** to replace custom CNN and boost accuracy.  
✅ Adapted the system from **few-shot to medium-shot learning** (1 image ➔ 5 images per class).  
✅ Built a **production-ready face verification pipeline**.

## 🔥 Model Architecture

### Siamese Network Structure:
- **Input:** Two face images.
- **Shared CNN:** Extract embeddings from both images.
- **Distance Layer:** Computes **absolute difference** of embeddings.
- **Final Dense Layer:** Predicts similarity score (0 = different, 1 = same).

Initially:
- CNN = Custom-designed CNN optimized with NAS.

Later:
- CNN = **MobileNetV2 (pretrained on ImageNet)** + fine-tuned layers.
